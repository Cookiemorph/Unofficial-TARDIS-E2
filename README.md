Unofficial-TARDIS-E2
====================

A Garry's Mod TARDIS E2 built upon Dr. Matt's official e2, by Cookiemorph. Packs more fun features for you to enjoy. Just spawn it in your TARDIS interior, type !help ingame, and it will display all the commands you need.

--Installation--------------------------------

Copy the data folder into your C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\<yourusername>\garrysmod\garrysmod folder.
Then, load it up in the E2 in game, and it's good to go. Remember, spawn it in the TARDIS Interior!
